# Introductory-Computational-Neuroscience
NEURO 120 at Harvard University

This course taught the fundamentals of computational neuroscience, ranging from data-driven analysis methods, such as PCA, ICA, and spike train analysis, to machine learning approaches, including convolutional neural networks for computer vision, recurrent neural networks, and reinforcement learning methods. Code and submissions will be included in this repo, including work on the final project, in which spike trains from primary auditory cortex were analyzed. Content of the homeworks is as follows:

1. Basics and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model
2. Spike Train Analysis, Spike-Triggered Averages, Random Neural Networks, Image Demixing
3. Vision, Visual Receptive Fields, AlexNet, Backpropagation
4. Short-Term Memory and Long-Term Memory
